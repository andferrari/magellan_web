# MAGELLAN
## Machine learning methods for the very large arrays in radio astronomy

MAGELLAN is a research project that aims to develop
algorithms for solving inverse problems of very large size.
The objective is the reconstruction of  "spatio-spectral" images by
very large networks of antennas in radio astronomy.

MAGELLAN (ANR-14-CE23-0004-01) is funded by 
[l'Agence Nationale de la Recherche](http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr)
